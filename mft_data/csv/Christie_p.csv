Chris Christie,R,p,"September 21, 2015",Press Release - Union Leader (Opinion) - Chris Christie is This Businessman's Pick for President,"Chris Christie is this businessman's pick for PresidentBill GreinerNew Hampshire Union Leader I can remember as a senior in college in Massachusetts making the trek to New Hampshire with friends to meet candidates during the 1988 election cycle. Not much has changed since then in terms of the campaigning; to be successful one must embrace retail campaigning New Hampshire style, doing town halls and criss-crossing our state day after day to connect with voters and spread the word. As an activist, businessman and former elected official, I take the New Hampshire primary very seriously. It allows candidates to be seen up close and personal, and it proves that there is more to this process than simply a name, a checkbook and a glitzy ad. Candidates have to be real, sincere and full of ideas, not simply attacks. In New Hampshire, we are fortunate to get to know the candidates beyond the headlines. I have been able to meet many of the Republican candidates this cycle, certainly the ones I was interested in meeting and who had ideas and plans that addressed some of the many problems that we face now as a country, as well as ones that are just down the road. The candidate I feel would best lead this country is Gov. Chris Christie. While I kept an open mind during this process, my bias had been toward a governor or former governor because one thing is clear: we need our next leader to be someone with executive experience who can lead. We also need our next leader to have a track record of being strong and principled, yet willing to compromise when necessary. For the past seven years, the word ""compromise"" has been non-existent in Washington. Gone are the days of bipartisanship and collaboration. Instead of tackling big issues such as the solvency of Social Security, immigration, drug addiction, the sustainability of Medicare, and ensuring that our country and citizens are safe, we have simply kicked the can down the road. We have a climate in Washington where some people feel that it is more important to win debates than to govern. This needs to stop. Gov. Christie is the one person who can change the tone and the dialogue and get our great country back on track. As someone who wakes up every day in a very blue state, with a legislature that has been and will continue to be controlled by Democrats the entire time he is in office, Gov. Christie understands compromise and how to get things done in a bipartisan way. When he was first elected, he inherited a budget that had less than four months of revenue before all of the money ran out and obligations could not be met. His first order of business was to sit down with the Democrat leaders in his legislature and hammer out a reasonable budget that would not bankrupt his state. During his time in office, Gov. Christie has continued to work in a bipartisan manner when possible and yet stand strong on principle when that is what was necessary. No governor has vetoed more tax increases in history than Chris Christie. Gov. Christie rightly understands that more money is not always the answer. We need to make sure that the programs we have are working, and we have to make sure that the money we are spending is not simply wasted. Gov. Christie has been very specific on what he would do to improve public education, eliminate government waste and ensure that both Social Security and Medicare are around for the future. His plans are detailed on his campaign website. Before Chris Christie was elected governor in New Jersey, he served over six years as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. During that time he prosecuted terrorists who were set on bringing harm to America. He also brought forth 130 cases of political corruption, which resulted in 130 convictions. Most of us are tired of simply hearing what is so wrong with our country; I want to hear how things will be addressed and what we can look forward to in the coming years. Gov. Christie is a tireless worker and a refreshing leader and will make a positive difference for our country. If you have not met Gov. Christie, you will have many opportunities in the coming months. Ask him the questions that matter to you, and then expect to get straight answers and not just political rhetoric. He is a straightforward as they come, and he is a refreshing candidate for President."

Chris Christie,R,p,"September 29, 2015",Press Release - Six Influential Iowa Business and Community Leaders Endorse Chris Christie For President,"For Immediate Release:  Tuesday, September 29, 2015  Watch here. MORRISTOWN, NJ - Today, six influential business and community leaders from across the state announced their endorsement of Chris Christie for President. These leaders first approached Governor Christie in 2011 to try to convince him to run for President and are still backing his candidacy even with a fifteen person field. They are committed to making a difference in Iowa and across the country, and know Governor Christie is a bold leader that will fight for the American people.  Bruce Rastetter, CEO, The Summit Group Denny Elwell, Chairman of Denny Elwell Company, LC Gary Kirke, Chairman, Wild Rose Casino and Resort and Founder, Kirke Financial Services Dr. Mike Richards, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Wild Rose Casino & Resorts Mikel Derby, Legislative Liaison for the Department of Transportation Jim Kersten, Former Iowa State Senator  TRANSCRIPT:  RASTETTER: Thank you and good morning. It's really a pleasure to be here today and to talk a little bit about the opportunity in the country and where it's headed. And I think a number of you are aware that in 2011, a little over 4 years ago, a group of us went to New Jersey and we went to New Jersey because we were concerned about the direction of the country and what was happening and the opportunity for future generations going forward. And so a group of us led by Denny Elwell, Gary Kirke, Mike Richards, Jim Kersten, Mikel Derby, and myself, went and tried to encourage then an early, new-term Governor to run for President and we encouraged him to run for President because we believed he had a bold leadership style, he had conviction and principle, and he would make a great President and so as we think about four years later in today's cycle, all those same things hold even more true. We have a country that is in more decline than what it was four years ago. It is in more need for leadership - in terms of bold leadership, principled leadership - than certainly it was in 2011 and we have a Governor who continues to be bold and direct and knowing what he thinks, and also having more experience in governing since 2011 to create that much more positive opportunity for the country, so as we took our time and we looked at a broader field that's out there, and those that have the leadership and the conviction to be able to be president, it became very clear to us that that same reason that we flew to New Jersey in 2011 exists today in even a greater way, that we have decided that we want to move forward endorsing Chris Christie for president. And we want other Iowans, other Iowans, to have an opportunity early on to be able to meet Chris Christie and have those kind of conversations that you had last night like at the town hall that we had, where they can see that kind of leadership, they can see the principle. But more importantly I think along with that, see a definitive response as to detail of how you're going to solve this country's problems and how actually Washington can go from being dysfunctional to functional because it actually has to operate and accomplish things. So with that, it's indeed my pleasure, as part of our group, to introduce to you the person that we think will be the next President of the United States, Chris Christie."

Chris Christie,R,p,"October 13, 2015",Press Release - ICYMI - Union Leader Editorial: Don't Call it a Comeback: Christie's Been Here for Years,"Don't call it a comeback: Christie's been here for yearsEditorial New Hampshire Union leader Christie looks to join Bill Clinton and John McCain in the club of presidential candidates who won the nomination after the Washington press corps declared their candidacies over. Christie is a conservative, pro-life governor elected twice in a liberal state. He's mastered the town meeting format like no one since McCain, and his outspoken style and eagerness to engage with his critics play well with flinty Granite State voters. Christie also has solid campaign fundamentals in place, including decent fundraising and one of the larger ground games in New Hampshire. He's a credible contender in a crowded GOP field, and that hasn't changed. ... Eight years ago today, Hillary Clinton and Rudy Guiliani were each leading their presidential fields by double digits. Chris Christie could win the Republican nomination. Or his campaign could fizzle out before Iowa. Stop watching the scoreboard. It's 0-0, and we won't start counting the votes for three more months."

Rob Wieczorek, President of Wieczorek Insurance and Board Chairman of the Farnum Center for Drug Recovery, commented, ""Through his compassionate words and principled actions, Governor Christie has been a national leader on the drug recovery movement. Governor Christie brought the drug epidemic to the forefront of the 2016 campaign at a time when it was not a popular subject to talk about. His words shed light on the human side of a struggle that impacts millions of American families. In New Jersey, he passed landmark, bipartisan legislation to create a drug court program that places first-time, nonviolent drug offenders in inpatient drug treatment programs so they can receive the treatment they need to combat addiction. His reforms have decreased prison populations, saved taxpayers money, and most importantly, given those struggling with addiction a second chance in our society.""

Chris Christie,R,p,"November 24, 2015","Press Release - ICYMI - TIME Magazine: ""It's Clear Christie is More Analytical and Prepared Than He Likes to Let On""","Chris Christie's New Pitch: Elect a Prosecutor-In-ChiefPhilip ElliottTIME Magazine For months, Chris Christie has struggled to grab national headlines. He toiled away in Iowa and New Hampshire without any real move in the polls. As his aides grumbled in frustration, Christie told them he valued the paced campaign, where behind-the-scenes work made the difference. After all, it's how he builtand woncases as the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey: have your homework in hand and be ready to take advantage of the opponents' errors. And they always made a mistake. The groundwork has the potential to pay off. The terror attacks in Paris, which left at least 130 dead, have shifted the race for the Republican Party's presidential nomination toward national security issues. It's a move Christie is ready to use to his advantage. ""Terrorism is not theoretical. It's not something I discuss in the basement of the Capitol, in a subcommittee meeting,"" Christie told Florida activists in mid-November. Terrorism in Christie's world is personal. Years before Christie became Governor, terrorism was a major part of his job. As the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, he lead major national security prosecutions after the September 11, 2001, terrorism attacks, and the lesson of his almost seven years in that office still shapes him today. ""Who among us has truly been tested?"" he asked the activists, casting himself as the lone Republican contender who can combat America's enemies. It's a theme he will hammer when he speaks to the Council on Foreign Relations on Tuesday in Washington. Christie's record as U.S. attorney, which has been glossed over as he has struggled in his presidential campaign, also reveals lesser-known qualities of a politician who has branded himself a tough-talker who never backs down from a fight. As a prosecutor, in repeated cases against corporate wrongdoers, Christie displayed a different set of attributes, including a willingness to compromise and settle cases with targets of his investigations. He broke repeatedly from the reckless bull-in-a-china-shop reputation Christie's critics like to ascribe him. Instead, in conversations with Christie, it's clear he is more analytical and prepared than he likes to let on. Two events in 2001 shaped his approach to how he wielded power: the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, and a corruption case against accounting giant Arthur Andersen. The former is now front and center in the Christie campaign, but the latter has also been there from the beginning. The question is whether the tide will shift enough in the Republican Party to let him rise to victory. "" I'm the only person in this race who has actually done this before,"" Christie said on CNN on Nov. 23. "" National security is not an option. It's a fundamental right. And that's what we will be focused on."" ... Bush White House phoned Christie on Sept. 10, 2001, to let him know that the 39-year-old was their pick to be the Justice Department's proxy in New Jersey. The next day, the scope of that role changed as the United States faced its deadliest day at home since the Civil War. ""I went to the funerals. I saw the carnage,"" Christie says of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. For hours that day, he could not get in touch with his wife, Mary Pat, who was working on Wall Street at the time. He had brief contact with her after the first plane struck the World Trade Center but spent hours trying to get through to her afterward. Christie still gets emotional when talking about his college sweetheart and that day when he feared he would soon be raising his four children as a single dad. When she finally returned to New Jersey, caked in dust from Lower Manhattan, Christie knew his new job would be anything but normal. The world had changed. On a smaller scale, that day also reshaped how Christie would structure the office he would start leading in January 2002. His Terrorism Unit was given the same stature as the Violent Crime Unit and the Narcotics Unita huge promotion of a previously backwater operation. Christie met with his dedicated terrorism investigators frequently and reported developments to the Deputy Attorney General for the United States. That man, James Comey, is now the FBI Director and someone Christie speaks of fondly... Read the full article here."

Christmas is ahead. We doubt that too many people across New Hampshire have politics front and center right now. But in just 10 weeks, New Hampshire will make a choice that will profoundly affect our country and the world. We better get it right. Our choice is Gov. Chris Christie. As a U.S. attorney and then a big-state governor, he is the one candidate who has the range and type of experience the nation desperately needs. We don't need another fast-talking, well-meaning freshman U.S. senator trying to run the government. We are still seeing the disastrous effects of the last such choice. Chris Christie is a solid, pro-life conservative who has managed to govern in liberal New Jersey, face down the big public unions, and win a second term. Gov. Christie can work across the aisle, but he won't get rolled by the bureaucrats. We don't need as President some well-meaning person from the private sector who has no public experience. Gov. Christie is right for these dangerous times. He has prosecuted terrorists and dealt admirably with major disasters. But the one reason he may be best-suited to lead during these times is because he tells it like it is and isn't shy about it. Other candidates have gained public and media attention by speaking bluntly. But it's important when you are telling it like it is to actually know what you are talking about. Gov. Christie knows what he is saying because he has experienced it. And unlike some others, he believes in what he says because he has a strong set of conservative values. Gov. Chris Christie is exactly the conservative Republican needed to take the fight to Hillary Clinton next fall and then get about the serious business of defending us and rebuilding our economy."

After meeting nearly every Republican candidate for President to evaluate their experience and their vision for our country, the Plummers called Christie the most tested and best prepared in these challenging times. ""Our country is at a tipping point: ISIS threatens America's security, drug use tears apart our families, and our veterans do not receive the care they have been promised in return for their service. After personally meeting with nearly every Republican candidate for President, we firmly believe that Chris Christie is the best equipped to face these challenges, and we proudly endorse him for President."" The Plummers added, ""Governor Christie has the strength to stand up for American interests and the compassion to believe in the potential of the American people. The times are too challenging to take a chance on inexperience - and no candidate is more tested and ready than Chris Christie."" ""Renee and Dan are not only accomplished business leaders, they are tireless advocates for veterans and dozens of charitable causes directly impacting the community. I am honored they have given me their support,"" said Governor Christie. ""Their passion and enthusiasm will be a tremendous asset to our New Hampshire team."" Renee Plummer serves as co-owner and Vice President of Marketing for Two International Group, a Portsmouth, New Hampshire development company. Plummer (nee Salerno) grew up in Mt. Kisco, NY (Westchester County), the daughter of Sicilian parents originally from the Bronx. As a teenager, she worked jobs at McDonald's and the Waldorf-Astoria but did not attend college. Plummer moved to New Hampshire in 1982 with her first husband, cardiologist John Riedel. In 1983, she gave birth to a daughter who passed away within days. The tragedy caused Plummer to organize a fundraiser for children in the neonatal unit at Exeter Hospital, which began her long involvement in charitable causes. In 1998, she and her second husband Danny Plummer began the redevelopment of the former Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth into an 850,000 square foot business and industrial park. Through her success in business, Plummer became a fixture in charitable causes for children, veterans and the arts. Plummer became active in Republican politics on the Seacoast in 1995 and served as an organizer for Bob Dole in 1996, George W. Bush in 2000, and John McCain in 2008. She is consistently named one of the most influential people in New Hampshire politics, including a recent article in Politico Magazine that said, ""To Win New Hampshire, You Have to Win Renee Plummer."" In 2012, Plummer served as a co-chair and RNC delegate for Gov. Jon Huntsman. In 2014, Gov. Rick Perry brought Plummer and her husband to Austin for dinner at the governor's mansion. In the 2016 presidential election cycle, Plummer has hosted Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Lindsey Graham, Gov. George Pataki, Sen. Rand Paul, Gov. Jeb Bush, Gov. John Kasich, Dr. Ben Carson, Donald Trump, and Carly Fiorina for private lunches and events. Dan Plummer is the President of Two International Group, a development company that is one of the largest firms in New Hampshire and has been active in the Portsmouth area for almost 40 years. Over the past ten years, Two International Group has built over 850,000 rentable square feet, with 16 buildings and more than 70 acres developed in the Pease International Tradeport. Dan has dedicated his professional career to redevelopment in Portsmouth, but also enjoys hosting Republican presidential candidates with his wife Renee, a Republican activist and Vice President of Marketing for Two International Group. Dan estimates that Two International pays more than $1 million a year in municipal service fees to Portsmouth."

Chris Christie has spoken compassionately about addiction and recovery in our society.

New Jersey's success under Governor Christie's leadership establishing drug courts that mandate treatment instead of incarceration is a model for the rest of the country."" ""Donna is a trailblazer and a New Hampshire icon, but most importantly she is an advocate for giving non-violent offenders a second chance and a champion of drug rehabilitation efforts,"" said Governor Christie.

Chris Christie,R,p,"December 2, 2015","Press Release - ICYMI - The Washington Post: In New Hampshire, No One Does Town Halls Quite Like Chris Christie","In New Hampshire, no one does town halls quite like Chris ChristieDan BalzThe Washington Post The art of the town hall is part of the lore and legend of New Hampshire's presidential politics. Everybody has to do them. New Hampshire voters demand it. In the contest for the Republican nomination, no one does them quite like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Marco Rubio does them. Ted Cruz does them. John Kasich, who needs New Hampshire as much as Christie, does them. Jeb Bush does them. Carly Fiorina does them. But not since Sen. John McCain of Arizona used town halls to upset then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the 2000 primary here, and then again to resurrect his candidacy in 2008, has a candidate tried to burrow into the Granite State in quite the way Christie is doing. Tuesday marked Christie's 50th day in the state. In that time, he's done three dozen town-hall meetings, often accompanied by his wife, Mary Pat. He claimed on Monday night he's been in the state more days than any other candidate and joked that his wife probably has recorded the second-most. Town halls can be held almost anywhere  VFW posts, schools auditoriums or gymnasiums, restaurants. Sometimes they are in living rooms, which on winter evenings in towns like Keene or Epping, with a light snow falling outside, create an atmosphere of intimacy between candidate and voters that is rare in politics today. On Monday night, the venue for Christie's town hall was another classic of the genre, the firehouse, in this case the Loudon Fire Department. At one end was an antique fire truck, Engine 2, complete with wooden ladders. At the other end was a more modern fire truck. In between, several hundred people were seated in folding chairs, their cars spilling out of the available parking lot to line both sides of the highway. ... The heart of any good town hall is the question-and-answer period. Christie revels in the Q&A.; He loves the banter and the give and take. Like McCain, he's willing to use barbed humor that might mildly offend some or even everyone in the audience in order to woo them all. On Monday night, he joked about the size of the New Hampshire House, which has more than 400 members, more than any other state in the country. In New Hampshire, they're a dime a dozen, he suggested, more than enough for every candidate to claim the support of lots of elected officials. To anyone in the state who suggests that they feel politically powerless in a world of big money and super PACs, Christie has a message: Stop whining. ""Man, if New Hampshire feels voiceless, imagine how Montana feels,"" he said to laughter. ... On Monday, he closed with an additional note: a reminder that the period of introduction by the candidates is now over. Now, he said, it's game time.

Chris Christie,R,p,"December 21, 2015",Press Release - New Hampshire Veterans Stand with Chris Christie for President,"Respected Veterans Coalition Leaders Chevalier, Havenstein, McCabe and Brothers Call Christie: ""Ready to Lead as Commander-in-Chief in a Dangerous World"" For Immediate Release:  Monday, December 21, 2015 MORRISTOWN, NJ - Today, sixty highly-respected military veterans including former New Hampshire VFW state commanders Paul Chevalier and Mark McCabe launched a Veterans for Christie coalition to promote Governor Christie's strong record of support for veterans as well as his unique national security experience as a U.S. Attorney who prosecuted terrorists in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. The veteran leadership team includes elected officials and community leaders from all ten New Hampshire counties. Sgt. Maj. Chevalier (ret.), who served three tours of duty in Vietnam and now travels across the country to advocate for veterans causes, will join Col. Walt Havenstein (ret.), the former CEO of BAE Systems and 2014 New Hampshire Republican gubernatorial nominee as co-chairs of the national Veterans for Christie coalition. Chevalier commented, ""Governor Christie is the serious, tested leader our nation needs at a time when we face the greatest threats to our homeland since 9/11. Veterans sacrificed to defend American values and protect the homeland, and they deserve a president who is both tough and experienced to keep our country safe."" Havenstein added, ""Veterans understand first-hand the importance of having a commander-in-chief who is prepared to make difficult decisions on day one. Governor Christie demonstrated his ability to manage in a crisis when he led his state through Hurricane Sandy, the second-worst natural disaster in American history. As U.S. attorney, he was responsible for working with the FBI and intelligence community to investigate and prosecute terrorists who were attempting to conduct attacks in his state. After eight years of untested and inexperienced leadership, we need Governor Christie in the Oval Office."" McCabe, a 20-year Navy veteran and immediate past-commander of the state VFW will serve as New Hampshire Veterans for Christie Co-Chair along with Richard Brothers, a Marine Corps veteran. Brothers served as the chair of the Veterans Affairs Committee as a member of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies and helped lead the Veterans for McCain Coalition. ""Governor Christie has a record of standing up for veterans in his state and providing them with the services they have earned through their service to our nation,"" said McCabe. ""Governor Christie has committed to reforming the VA by bringing in experienced hospital leaders to manage the system, and he supports allowing veterans to receive care from any medical institution so they can access quality treatment in a timely manner. After the sacrifices they have made for our country, veterans deserve a government that keeps its word. Governor Christie is the experienced executive we need to spearhead reforms for the VA and achieve results for our nation's veterans."" ""Governor Christie brought Democrats and Republicans in his legislature together to save a veterans support hotline in New Jersey that provides critical mental health services to veterans across the country,"" added Brothers. ""After the federal government eliminated funding for the program, Governor Christie was able to get both parties to work together to fund the Vets4Warriors peer support hotline. Washington needs an experienced executive who cares more about serving the American people and getting results than continuing the endless partisan bickering.""

Chris Christie,R,p,"December 23, 2015",Press Release - Scott L. Bach: Chris Christie's Strong Record Supporting N.J. Gun Owners,"Another View -- Scott L. Bach: Chris Christie's strong record supporting N.J. gun ownersUnion Leader Opinion Scott L. Bach When evaluating an elected official's record on guns, I am much more interested in what they do than what they say. Politicians pay lip service to the Second Amendment, but until they are battle-tested, their real posture is an open question. That question has already been answered about Gov. Chris Christie in New Jersey  one of the most hostile environments for gun rights in America. Gov. Christie's record of action on the Second Amendment is strong. As executive director of New Jersey's state rifle and pistol association, I am in a good position to know. After years of bruising legislative battles, I have watched Gov. Christie repeatedly save New Jersey's law-abiding firearms owners from gun bans, magazine bans and absurd regulatory schemes from politicians who speak openly about confiscating guns. New Jersey isn't like New Hampshire or most other states when it comes to gun rights. Embedded deep within every branch of government, for decades, is a culture that actively delays, disparages and denies Second Amendment rights, viciously persecuting gun owners under a tangled legal web that is reflexively upheld by the courts. The hostility toward gun rights is palpable and enthusiastically reinforced by the media. Lawmakers supporting gun rights are savaged and targeted for defeat. Maybe that's why Chris Christie is the first governor in New Jersey history ever to veto a gun ban or magazine ban. Maybe it's why Christie is the first governor ever to pardon citizens prosecuted just for possessing legally-owned firearms (he pardoned four). Maybe it's why no Garden State governor before Christie ever used executive powers to facilitate carry permits for those in danger, or to convene a commission to develop other executive actions addressing widespread permitting abuses. Or why Christie is the first New Jersey governor ever to acknowledge the difference between legislation targeting gun rights versus gun criminals. Gov. Christie isn't perfect, but he has the strongest Second Amendment record of any governor in New Jersey history, and the state's gun owners are very grateful for it. That point is not debatable. Without Gov. Christie's intervention, New Jersey would now have bans on 50 caliber firearms and ammunition magazines over 10 rounds. The state would have a giant digital licensing bureaucracy where big brother could switch off gun rights by pushing a button. It would have an expanded statewide ""assault"" firearms ban, and a ban on every conventional handgun ever made courtesy of New Jersey's ""smart gun"" law. Gov. Christie blocked both. Without Gov. Christie, there would be no new confidentiality law protecting gun owners' personal information, and police would be forced to compromise federally protected gun trace data. There would be no state bear hunt addressing increasing bear attacks (including a fatal mauling last year), and no new apprentice youth hunting program preserving outdoor traditions. And there would be no new executive actions from a Christie-appointed commission addressing New Jersey's medieval mistreatment of gun owners. Gov. Christie has taken a liberal media pounding for these actions. Through his vetoes, executive actions and pardons, Christie disrupted the gun ban agenda in New Jersey despite intense public pressure, while sweeping bans were passed in New York, Connecticut and Colorado. Under cover of these events, it would have been easy for Christie to bow to public pressure and overreact, rather than taking disciplined, logical action defending gun rights. I am neutral in the Republican presidential primary. But as a political observer I have watched some commentators ignore Gov. Christie's record of action and proclaim him hostile to gun rights for things he supposedly said 20 years ago. What matters most to me as a gun rights leader is what a lawmaker does, not what he says. And while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, they are not entitled to their own facts. It is irrefutable that Gov. Christie has saved New Jersey gun owners from legislative catastrophe again and again, at their most vulnerable moment. Now he is taking unprecedented executive action on systemic permitting abuses. Gun owners want Gov. Christie to continue these steps for as long as he holds office. Those who refuse to give him credit where credit is due erode the incentive to keep defending gun rights in a place where it is wildly unpopular to do so. Scott L. Bach, Esq. is executive director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs and a member of the NRA board of directors. Read the article here."

Chris Christie,R,p,"January 15, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI - George Will: Keep an Eeye on Chris Christie,"Keep an eye on Chris ChristieGeorge F. Will, Washington Post Columnist Delaware Online Iowa and New Hampshire together have just 1.4 percent of the U.S. population, which is actually why it is fine for them to begin the presidential selection process: Small states reward an underdog's retail politics. Chris Christie relishes such politics and has fresh evidence that voters are enjoying his enjoyment. Speaking last Wednesday by phone from his home away from home, New Hampshire, he said: ""People have remembered why they liked me in the first place."" His saturation campaigning there has produced a 55-point reversal of his favorable/unfavorable rating in the Granite State, from 16 points more unfavorable than favorable to 39 points more favorable than unfavorable. According to last week's Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll, Christie's favorability number in Iowa is 51 percent, up from 29 percent in August, when his unfavorability number was 59 percent. ... Christie will campaign in Iowa for nine days before the Feb. 1 caucuses. If they yield a cloudy result -- say, the top four finishers clustered within four points -- New Hampshire will become the scythe that reduces the field. Christie plans to be ""the last governor standing"" when, after South Carolina at the latest, he expects former Govs. Mike Huckabee and Jeb Bush and current Gov. John Kasich to join current and former Govs. Scott Walker, Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, George Pataki and Jim Gilmore on the sidelines. ... ""I was not on the 1/8 debate 3/8 stage two months ago,"" Christie says. He expects to be at the center of the stage at the Cleveland convention. Read the full article here. "
Chris Christie,R,p,"January 17, 2016","Press Release - ICYMI - Foster's Daily Democrat Op-Ed: Jeff Chidester: Christie Has Sense, Maturity, Intellect","Christie has sense, maturity, intellectFoster's Daily DemocratJeff Chidester  Who are you supporting? You will either answer the question with conviction, reservation or uncertainty. In almost every other state, the presidential candidates and policies we support or oppose attract very little attention except maybe in an active political circle. But we live in New Hampshire, where the conversation of politics is as natural as talking about the weather; the only difference is that confusing partly cloudy with partly sunny usually won't end in a fist fight. Being a participant of the First-in-the-Nation Primary is fraught with danger, even for someone as seasoned as me. I take my role as a public figure very seriously. Whether or not people agree with me, there is a trust established between those who read my article, listen to my radio show or invite me to speak in front of their organization. It is my belief that failing to share with you who I am supporting, all while continuing my public commentary, would be a violation of this trust. With that said, I wanted to let you know why I have decided to enthusiastically support New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for president and why I am encouraging all those who are still undecided to consider Christie. The first thing that impressed me about the governor was his approach to governing. Christie governed as a conservative in one of the most fiscally liberal states in the country. Unlike many of the others running for president this cycle, Christie has had to govern with a legislative body that overwhelmingly consisted of representatives from the opposition party. Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey by more than 700,000 votes, yet Christie has governed as a conservative, building consensus with Republicans, Democrats and Independents. ... Under Christie, New Jersey has become the role model for criminal justice reform and veterans care. Christie's efforts proved so successful that the New Jersey prison population has been reduced to the point it can now close one prison. However, Christie is not going to just board up the prison to sell it to a private entity. Working with the private and nonprofit sector, he is leading the charge to convert the former prison to a state-of-the-art drug treatment center. Christie believes we need to stop treating drug addiction purely as a criminal matter, and start treating it as a health care issue. He is not only proving to be a leader for New Jersey on this issue, but for the nation. Christie's commitment to veterans is extremely impressive. When the federal government shut off funding to the Rutgers University-operated suicide prevention hotline (Vets4Warriors), Christie showed true leadership and stepped up to save the program. Vets4Warriors hotline is now funded thanks to Christie and the people of New Jersey, yet remains accessible to all veterans across the country. Accountability and dedication, those are characteristics of Christie's leadership style. A style we need leading our country. Regardless of your party affiliation or political ideology, none of that matters if you cannot govern. Christie proved, much like Ronald Reagan did, that you can govern as a classic conservative without always alienating people of differing opinions. All too often we criticize from ""the hip."" Those who have never had to govern claim how ""if they were in charge, things would be different,"" as if somehow they have a magic wand that others do not possess. Governing is not easy, but some people rise to the occasion. One such person is Gov. Christie. Read the full op-ed here.

""From my service as a part of the Reagan White House team and later as a United States Senator from Nebraska working closely with, and admiring the leadership of, President Reagan, our next president needs to be a person of the highest character and integrity who will bring to the presidency, on day 1, the type of wisdom, judgment, leadership and respect that only comes from real experience. In our ever dangerous and complex world 'learning on the job' to govern, manage and lead is unacceptable. There is only one person among the candidates for president that would bring to the office these qualities and that person is Governor Chris Christie,"" said Senator Karnes. ""Governor Christie is the strong, experienced leader our country needs. He has worked with an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature in New Jersey to balance the budget, cut taxes, reform pensions, and reduce the size and cost of government. His background as a former U.S. Attorney and as a governor of a large state gives him the critical national security and executive experience our country needs right now. Governor Christie is ready to be president on day one. I am supporting Governor Christie for president and urge everyone to join me."" ""I am incredibly honored to have Senator Karnes on our team,"" said Governor Christie. ""As we get closer to the first votes and our support continues to grow across the early primary states, leaders like Senator Karnes are crucial to helping spread our message to voters throughout the country.""

Chris Christie,R,p,"January 21, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI - ABC News: Chris Christie Gets Emotional on the Campaign Trail,"Chris Christie Gets Emotional on the Campaign TrailJordyn PhelpsABC News On a cold winter night in New London, New Hampshire, recently, a man rose to his feet at a town hall meeting to appeal to Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie for solutions to blunt the scourge of mass shootings in the United States, brimming with frustration as he revealed that he knew two people killed in two separate mass shootings. Sitting down on the stool in the center of the room, the New Jersey governor at first acknowledged that ""gun violence is a threat to our safety and security"" before launching into a minutes-long explanation of his opposition to stricter gun control measures, making the case that the true culprit is untreated mental illness. ""Whether it was the kid at Virginia Tech, or the kids in Columbine, or the kid at Sandy Hook, every one of them there were signs,"" he said. ""And you remember the interviews afterward, they are like, 'Yeah we knew there was a problem.' Well, we need to do something about it."" Over the course of the event, Christie would draw the audience's undivided attention time and again -- to laugh and even to cry -- in traversing the full spectrum of emotion within the stretch of a two-hour-long question-answer session. ... Christie's ability to captivate his audiences on an emotional level is at the heart of his strategy to move voters into his camp, with the campaign now seeking to capitalize on some of their candidates most powerful moments with a new video series titled ""True Heart,"" which is named after Christie's answer to a debate question in which the candidates were asked what their Secret Service name would be. The first video, released this week, features an exchange Christie had with an Iowan man who suffered from a severe stroke and aphasia. ""I can see in your eyes the frustration and the sadness that this brings to you and it touches my heart,"" Christie tells the afflicted man in a video released by the campaign from a Coralville, Iowa, town hall. By the end of his extensive answer, as Christie thanked the stroke victim for his bravery to ask the question, the stroke victim rose to his feet, eyes glistening, to shake Christie's hand. ... And as if to seal in the emotional impact of his town halls, Christie often closes with the story of his mother's death, recalling that he cut a work trip short to rush back to his mother's deathbed in the final days of a battle with lung cancer. ""She reached over she grabbed my hand and said to me, 'Christopher go to work, it's where you belong, there is nothing left unsaid between us,'"" Christie says, causing more than a few eyes to well up in the audiences. ""Other than the birth of our four children it was the single most powerful moment of my life. My mother was giving me permission to let her go."" Read the full article here. "

Chris Christie,R,p,"February 3, 2016",Press Release - ICYMI - Union Leader Op-Ed: Chris Christie: Deciding America's Place in the World,"Deciding America's place in the worldChris ChristieNew Hampshire Union Leader America's foreign policy was once defined by clear, principled leadership. We stood for the defense of freedom everywhere, and the defense of our homeland at all costs. Now no one understands what we stand for, or who we stand with or against. Over the last few years, we've seen the American ship of state run aground on the shoreline of reality through the incompetent captaining of Barack Obama and his first mate, Hillary Clinton. Is it a surprise that we got played again by Iran three weeks ago? Is it any surprise that Russia is now in Crimea and Ukraine? Is it a surprise that North Korea is saber rattling with nukes? Is it a surprise that an arc of terror now extends from Libya to Syria to Yemen  and all the way to the streets of Europe and America? In many ways, the situation today reminds me of the late 1970s. Then, we had another crippling lack of leadership from another Democratic President. It was only through a change in leadership at home that America's leadership abroad was guaranteed. In 2016, we have a chance to make that change again. We have a chance to lead again. And if I'm President a year from now, this is how we're going to do it. Our number one priority will be to keep our country safe. The first and most important job as President of the United States is to protect the safety and security of Americans. This land is where our children are born, it's where our grandparents are buried. This is our home. On Sept. 11, 2001, my wife, Mary Pat, was working two blocks from the World Trade Center in New York. I remember those long hours waiting to find out if she was OK. In the days after, we learned of the friends, neighbors and people in our lives who we would never see again. Those days weren't that long ago. Today, our homeland is still threatened. So we need to strengthen our defenses at home and abroad against every possible foe. We need to strengthen our borders. We need to continue building our strength on land, sea, air, space and cyberspace. That also means stepping up our game dramatically in intelligence. ... And we should not be ashamed to put our national interests first. It's fashionable for academics and industry leaders to talk about how we live in a global community. But it is countries that define that community, and it is America that is the world's last, best hope to keep the peace. We shouldn't ever apologize for putting our country first and choosing to live in the world as it is  not the fantasy world that President Obama wishes for. It is time we restore some reality to our country's foreign policy. In this election, you will have a chance to do that and to decide America's place in the world. U.S. leadership in the world is often an opportunity, sometimes a burden  but it's absolutely never a choice. Our country and the world is crying out for American strength from the Oval Office. A Christie administration will provide strength and security in a dangerous world. Read the full op-ed here. "
Chris Christie,R,p,"February 4, 2016",Press Release - Christie is Tough Enough to Lead in a Post-9/11 World,"Tom ColantuonoNew Hampshire Union Leader As New Hampshire primary voters, we have the opportunity to see the presidential candidates as they campaign in our communities. If the candidates spend enough time here, we may have a chance to meet them and talk with them for a few moments to decide which one we want to support. My support this year is based on a much deeper relationship  I actually worked with one of the candidates and got to know him personally, which made my decision clear. I served as New Hampshire's U.S. Attorney when Chris Christie served in that role in New Jersey. We represented the Department of Justice as the chief federal law enforcement officers in our states. I saw firsthand Chris Christie's strength, courage and intelligence, but that is not the only reason I have endorsed him for President. ... In the months that followed, we were directed by President Bush to use the full resources of the federal government to protect the homeland from future attacks. Chris Christie led the prosecution of five radical Islamic terrorists who were plotting an attack against the Fort Dix military base in his state. Three of the terrorists were in the United States as illegal aliens. In the evidence collected against them, the jihadists discussed their hatred of America and their plot to acquire rocket propelled grenades to kill as many soldiers as possible. Working with the FBI, the intelligence community, and local law enforcement agencies, Christie successfully led one of the largest anti-terrorism prosecutions in the aftermath of Sept. 11. Gov. Christie understands the threats posed by radical Islamic terrorism and illegal immigration. Gov. Christie will be a law-and-order President, something we are sorely lacking in the Oval Office. We need a President who supports our police officers and appreciates our military for the sacrifices they make to keep our families safe. And we need a President who understands that justice is our way of life because justice ensures all Americans play by the same rules. ... Every time I visit New York City, I stop by the September 11th Memorial to see my cousin's name etched in the granite by the reflecting pool. It reminds me in these dangerous times that keeping America safe is the solemn responsibility of the President. Gov. Christie is the one I trust to keep us safe, and he is the only tough and tested executive in this election up to the challenge. Read the full op-ed here."

His solid record of getting results for the people of New Jersey while balancing every budget, cutting spending, vetoing more tax hikes than any Governor in American history, and creating over 230,000 private-sector jobs shows that he is ready to take on the serious challenges our next President will face.""

Their experience and voices will be incredibly important not just over the next four days, but through November.""

Chris Christie,R,p,"February 8, 2016",Press Release - VFW State Commander Lew Chipola and Gold Star Mother Natalie Healy Endorse Chris Christie for President,"For Immediate Release:  Monday, February 8, 2016 MORRISTOWN, NJ - On the day before New Hampshire's First In The Nation Presidential Primary, Governor Chris Christie received the public endorsement of two of the state's most dedicated Veterans advocates, Gold Star Mother Natalie Healy and VFW State Commander Lew Chipola. ""Governor Christie is the sensible, intelligent problem solver we need in the White House,"" said Healy. ""He answers questions with specific, direct solutions based on his experience leading his state as governor. Governor Christie's town hall meeting educated, inspired, and energized me and confirmed my belief after Saturday night's debate that he is the only candidate with the character and qualities we need in our next commander-in-chief. Our country needs a president who is straightforward with the American people, not another politician who presents lofty, ambiguous ideals. Governor Christie has the experience of a strong, tough leader combined with the wit and humor Americans need to give us hope that brighter days are ahead. Governor Christie will be the experienced captain of our sacred ship, and only he can guide it with confidence through the dangerous shoals ahead."" ""As a governor with executive experience managing a complex state, Governor Christie is prepared to make tough decisions and deliver results as our next president,"" said Chipola. ""Governor Christie's strong leadership style and direct approach will help America regain the confidence of our allies and will send a clear message to our enemies. As a former US Attorney who prosecuted corrupt politicians and terrorists, I know Chris Christie is tough enough to take on the serious challenges that Congress is afraid to face. He passed historic reforms in New Jersey that many thought were impossible, and he has the experience to reform the VA to ensure that our veterans receive the proper treatment they have earned through their service."" US Army Lt. Colonel Lew Chipola (ret.) of Nashua serves as the New Hampshire State Commander of the VFW. Natalie Healy of Exeter lost her son, Navy SEAL Senior Chief Petty Officer Daniel Healy on June 28, 2005 when his helicopter was shot down in Kunar Province, Afghanistan. The story of the attack was the basis for the book and motion picture Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell. Chipola and Healy will join the Veterans for Christie coalition led by national co-chairs Paul Chevalier and Walt Havenstein and New Hampshire co-chairs Mark McCabe and Richard Brothers.
