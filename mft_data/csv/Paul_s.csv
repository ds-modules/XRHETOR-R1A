Rand Paul,R,s,"May 30, 2015",Statement by Senator Rand Paul on NSA Spying,"I have fought for several years now to end the illegal spying of the NSA on ordinary Americans. The callous use of general warrants and the disregard for the Bill of Rights must end. Forcing us to choose between our rights and our safety is a false choice and we are better than that as a nation and as a people.That's why two years ago, I sued the NSA. It's why I proposed the Fourth Amendment Protection Act. It's why I have been seeking for months to have a full, open and honest debate on this issue  a debate that never came.So last week, seeing proponents of this illegal spying rushing toward a deadline to wholesale renew this unconstitutional power, I filibustered the bill. I spoke for over 10 hours to call attention to the vast expansion of the spy state and the corresponding erosion of our liberties.Then, last week, I further blocked the extension of these powers and the Senate adjourned for recess rather than stay and debate them.Tomorrow, we will come back with just hours left before the NSA illegal spying powers expire.Let me be clear: I acknowledge the need for a robust intelligence agency and for a vigilant national security.I believe we must fight terrorism, and I believe we must stand strong against our enemies.But we do not need to give up who we are to defeat them. In fact, we must not.There has to be another way. We must find it together.So tomorrow, I will force the expiration of the NSA illegal spy program.I am ready and willing to start the debate on how we fight terrorism without giving up our liberty.Sometimes when the problem is big enough, you just have to start over. The tax code and our regulatory burdens are two good examples.Fighting against unconditional, illegal powers that take away our rights, taken by previous Congresses and administrations is just as important.I do not do this to obstruct. I do it to build something better, more effective, more lasting, and more cognizant of who we are as Americans."
Rand Paul,R,s,"June 25, 2015",Statement by Senator Rand Paul on the Supreme Court's Obamacare Decision,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Sen. Rand Paul issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold Obamacare subsidies: ""This decision turns both the rule of law and common sense on its head. Obamacare raises taxes, harms patients and doctors, and is the wrong fix for America's health care system. As President I would make it my mission to repeal it, and propose real solutions for our healthcare system. As a physician I know Americans need a healthcare system that reconnects patients, families, and doctors, rather than growing government bureaucracy,"" Sen. Rand Paul said."
Rand Paul,R,s,"July 15, 2015",Statement by Senator Rand Paul on Planned Parenthood,"Sen. Rand Paul today announced his plan to defeat and defund Planned Parenthood. Next week, Sen. Paul will seek to strip Planned Parenthood of its taxpayer funding, which totaled roughly $528.4 million dollars in 2013 - 2014. Sen. Paul will use all legislative vehicles at his disposal in order to ensure there is immediate action on this proposal.""I am more appalled than ever by Planned Parenthood's complete disregard for the sanctity of human life. The recent revelation that this taxpayer-funded organization is selling body parts of the unborn further proves that this agency deserves our scorn not our tax dollars. I plan to do whatever I can to stop them and will introduce an amendment to pending Senate legislation to immediately strip every dollar of Planned Parenthood funding,"" Sen. Paul said."
Rand Paul,R,s,"December 3, 2015",Statement by Senator Rand Paul on the Defend Our Capital Act of 2015,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator and Republican Presidential candidate Rand Paul introduced legislation that would remove existing restrictive firearm ownership laws in the District of Columbia, and require the District of Columbia to issue and grant reciprocity for concealed weapons permits for both residents and non-residents.The Defend Our Capital Act of 2015 was offered as an amendment to H.R.3761, Restoring American's Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. Following the introduction of this legislation, Sen. Paul issued the statement below:""For too long the Americans who live in and visit their nation's capital have been prevented from defending themselves and their loved ones. No longer should our citizens have to choose between safety or visiting Washington, D.C."""
Rand Paul,R,s,"December 6, 2015",Statement by Senator Rand Paul on President Obama's Address to the Nation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator and Republican Presidential candidate Rand Paul issued the following statement in response to President Obama's address to the nation:""The President tonight continued his failure of leadership and his outrageous quest to turn a necessary discussion on terrorism and national security into an unnecessary and ineffective gun control debate.Let me be clear: disarming more law-abiding citizens will not stop mass murderers and terrorists. We should be advocating for more concealed carry ability for law-abiding Americans and an end to unconstitutional gun-free zones. Second, we must fully examine and reform our border security, including refugee and visa programs. While the President paid lip service to this fight, he plans to keep the failed, current policies in place and allow tens of thousands of refugees to enter our country.I couldn't disagree more strongly. Immigration, visas, and refugees from countries with active terror networks must be halted while we determine how to better secure our borders and our people.Finally, we must stop doing the same foolish things overseas that the President advocated for throughout his remarks. We must stop arming and training the allies of ISIS and al Qaeda.We should not double down on this failed and dangerous policy that the President called for tonight. We must arm our allies, the Kurds, and insist on Arab boots on the ground for our allies in the region.There are answers here to make our nation safe, but once again the President seems incapable of finding and implementing them. His administration is focused on gun laws that will not stop terrorists, while pushing policies that will let more of them into the country. It is 100 percent wrong and proves the need for new leadership in the White House."""
Rand Paul,R,s,"January 11, 2016",Statement by Senator Rand Paul on the Fox Business Debate,"WASHINGTON, DC - Today the RNC and Fox Business will decide and announce which candidates are on the main stage for this week's Republican Presidential debate. The criteria for participation includes placing in the top six in recent polls.Multiple national polls including CNN, CBS, Fox, Marist and others have him in 5th or 6th place, one had him just a single point out of 4th.

In yesterday's Marist Iowa poll he was alone in 5th place.By any reasonable criteria Senator Paul has a top-tier campaign and has qualified for the stage.""This race is hitting its final stretch and Rand Paul is a serious contender for the nomination. He expects to be on the stage this week because he has qualified to do so and because he has a top tier campaign. He is on the ballot in every state. He has over 1000 precinct captains in Iowa and a huge 500 person leadership team in New Hampshire,"" said Doug Stafford, Chief Strategist."
