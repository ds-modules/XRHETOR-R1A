Anthony List's Pro-Life Pledge,"New Orleans, LA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) issued the following statement in reaction to the announcement by the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) regarding Governor Mitt Romney's refusal to sign the Pro-Life Leadership Pledge. ""This past Monday night at the Republican Presidential Debate, I was asked about Governor Romney's pro-life conversion, and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I apparently spoke too soon. It is incredibly disappointing that Governor Romney chose not to defend those who cannot defend themselves,"" said Senator Santorum.During his time in the Senate, Senator Santorum proudly stood in the forefront of the nation's pro-life battles - from authoring the ban on partial-birth abortions to the ""Born Alive Infant Protection Act,"" and ""Unborn Victims of Violence Act,"" which is more commonly known as ""Laci and Connor's Law."" Senator Santorum also led the fight on the floor of the United States Senate in support of strict constructionist judges against the unwarranted and unprecedented filibusters by the then-Democratic minority.Additional announced candidates who did not take the pledge include Herman Cain and former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson."

""Every American wants our brave men and women home safely, but we cannot let those who've given the last full measure die in vain by abandoning the gains we've made thus far. We must be squarely focused on succeeding in Afghanistan rather than on politically motivated troop withdrawals. Sadly, President Obama doesn't seem to share that commitment."""

""This is a real opportunity for our nation's leaders to come together, cut and cap government spending, and, most importantly, pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to our Constitution so that we never have to raise our nation's debt limit again."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"July 11, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum on a Disappointing Jobs Report,"Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in reaction to this morning's jobs report that found that only 18,000 new jobs were created in the month of June and that unemployment had risen to 9.2%.""This morning's jobs report is one more sign that the current Administration's policies are impeding economic growth in America,"" said Senator Santorum. ""This past week in Iowa, I laid out a very clear vision for creating jobs and growing our economy. I would urge President Obama to go out and talk to the people in America's heartland and hear their concerns, and I would hope that he would see that they are looking for a President who believes in them again and not continued reliance on ineffective, big government bureaucracies. That is exactly what my plan to eliminate the corporate tax burden for U.S. manufacturers, streamline the patent and FDA approval process, and increase incentives for research and development would do. I look forward to having this debate with the President, because it is clear his plan is not working for America."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"July 11, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum on the President's Press Briefing,"Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in reaction to President Obama's press briefing this morning focused on the ongoing debt limit negotiations.""I continue to be deeply concerned about the direction President Obama is taking the negotiations to raise our nation's debt limit,"" said Senator Santorum. ""The president's focus on picking winners and losers through targeted job growth and raising taxes as our economy teeters on the brink is irresponsible. The president and congressional leaders need to make the difficult decisions about spending cuts now, and prioritize passing a Balanced Budget Amendment so that we end the market's concern about our nation's escalating debt problems."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"July 20, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum on Dan Savage and His Obscene Attack,"Earlier this morning, I emailed my supporters about last week's episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" on HBO, where he and his guest, hate activist Dan Savage broke into vile attacks against me and other conservatives. The attacks were too disgusting and sexually explicit to repeat here, but I did want to share my interview with Steve Malzberg of WOR in New York City - a responsible radio host who was just as disgusted as I was by the media's treatment of conservatives like us. I can only imagine if this happened to a liberal. Maher and his friends in the Mainstream Media would hit the roof - and rightly so! But when it happens to a conservative, they applaud and laugh. Remember this is not the first time Savage has attacked us on our stance of supporting American values. Savage and his perverted sense of humor is the reason why my children cannot Google their father's name. I took the high road for nearly a decade by not dignifying these mindless attacks, then even defending his 1st Amendment right to spew this filth. And to this day, liberals like Rachel Maddow serve as Savage's lackeys on national television, pushing his smut. Enough is enough, and I'll keep fighting these attacks to ensure that the extreme lest doesn't win."
Rick Santorum,R,s,"August 2, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum on the Debt Ceiling Agreement,"Des Moines, IA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement regarding the agreement reached by Congressional Democrats and Republicans and the White House to raise the debt ceiling:""I commend Speaker Boehner, Leader McConnell, and the conservative leadership for moving the ball in the right direction,"" said Senator Santorum. ""Unfortunately, this deal does not go far enough and it is not one that would have been made by a Santorum Administration because it does not accomplish the necessary goal of balancing the budget. It is also disappointing that those members of congress who want to be our president were not leaders in the legislature to advance the conservative cause. As president, I will be committed to passing a Balanced Budget Amendment to once and for all ensure we never again put our nation's fiscal health in jeopardy."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"August 6, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum on the Downgrade of U.S. Debt,"Urbandale, IA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in response to S&P;'s decision to downgrade U.S. debt from AAA Rating.""If this downgrade holds, then it's another example in a long line of examples of the President's failure of leadership. Is anyone surprised at this point? There are 14 million people out of work and looking to the White House for answers - but they are receiving nothing but a blank stare. The markets are scared and the credit downgrade has happened because the President and this Congress continue to address the symptoms and not the disease. This nation is spending more money than it takes in and the world knows it - now, it's time to show the world that the United States has the fortitude and resolve to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to stop out of control spending and shrink the scope of government once and for all. The deal the President cut with Congress was supposed to avoid this downgrade but all it did was once again kick the can down the road. President Obama and his Administration have been a failure.I understand the US Treasury is going back to Standard and Poors to say that a two trillion dollar mathematical error by S&P; contributed to the downgrade. So, in addition to blaming President Bush for all of its problems, now the White House is blaming S&P; - but this happened on the President's watch - and he has to deal with it. I guess President Obama is left to cling to the ""hope"" that a mathematical error caused this. Is that the ""hope"" the President was talking about?Folks, an AA rating should be so far in our rear view mirror that no mathematical error should affect it. Tonight, I'm saddened for the millions out of work - but I'm hopeful that I will replace Barack Obama as President and get this country and its economy moving again."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"August 18, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum on White House Call for Syrian President Assad's Resignation,"Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in response to President Obama's call for Syrian President Assad to step down.""Assad's regime has the blood of freedom seeking Syrians on its hands. It is about time that the Obama Administration stepped to the plate and called for the long-awaited resignation of President Assad. Nearly a decade ago I worked to remove the Syrian threat from the doorstep of our ally Israel, and it is shocking that it has taken President Obama this long to realize that Syria is a threat to not just the region, but to its own people,"" concluded Senator Santorum.Senator Santorum was the author of the bipartisan Syria Accountability Act, which was signed into law by President Bush in 2003. This critical piece of legislation to not just American security, but Israeli security, worked to end Syria's presence in Lebanon and end the illegal shipment of military goods to anti-U.S. forces in Iraq."
Rick Santorum,R,s,"August 25, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum Reacting To Mayor Bloomberg's Decision To Not Include Clergy At 9/11 Memorial,"Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in reaction to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's decision not to offer clergy a role in the 10th anniversary ceremony commemorating the terrorist attacks of 9/11.""James Madison called our nation's vibrant public expression of faith the 'perfect remedy' and if there was ever a day in recent history that our nation needed such a remedy it was September 11th, 2001. It is disconcerting that Mayor Bloomberg decided to exclude clergy from the ceremony commemorating the 10th anniversary of this horrific attack. I urge Mayor Bloomberg to reconsider his unfortunate decision. It is important to allow clergy to attend and take part in the memorial intended to bind the wounds of a still healing nation."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"August 26, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum on the GDP Growth Downgrade,"Struggling U.S. Economy In Desperate Need Of Tax and Budget SuretyVerona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in response to new data showing that our economy grew at an even more anemic pace than originally thought, growing at only 1.0% rather than 1.3% annually.Sen. Santorum said, ""This is just another example that President Obama's economic policies have failed. President Obama needs to change course now before we officially sink into another recession. It's time to lower tax rates and reduce the regulatory burden to incentivize manufacturing jobs back in the U.S. Our country needs to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to our Constitution so markets know we are serious about fiscal sustainability and that we will not fall into the trap far too many European countries find themselves in today."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"September 2, 2011","Statement by Senator Santorum - ""...President Obama's Economic Policies Would Need to Improve Dramatically to Even be Described as 'Incompetent'""","Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in response to this morning's disappointing jobs report.Senator Santorum said, ""This morning's jobs report is another sad sign that President Obama's economic policies would need to improve dramatically to even be described as incompetent. For three years, in speech after speech, the President has claimed to be focused on the American worker, but month after month and report after report shows the opposite. So either, the President's economic policies are killing this economy or his lack of leadership - either way, President Obama is to blame. Employers need certainty and freedom to expand and that what my jobs plan would do.""In July, Senator Santorum released his jobs plan focusing on putting America back to work, with a focus on the ""great middle of America,"" the manufacturing sector. Senator Santorum's plan would: Eliminate the corporate tax for all domestic manufacturers (take it from 35% to 0%); Repatriate taxes on profits secured overseas at a 5% rate rather than the current 35% tax rate; Reduce regulatory burdens on manufacturers; and Expand domestic energy exploration to lower energy costs for manufacturers."

But in our darkest hour, the heroism of the American spirit served as a beacon of strength, light, hope and healing for the entire world. As a nation we came together - rejecting what divides us and instead we were clinging to what makes us one nation under God. Today, let's reflect on that unifying American spirit - remembering and praying for those innocent people who lost their lives 10 years ago. May God bless the United States and her people as we continue to heal from the decade old wounds - and may this day serve as a sobering reminder that we must remain united and vigilant against the radical threat that still looms, seeking to destroy us not for what we have done but for who we are as a people."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"September 12, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum on Remembering 9/11,"As we mark the 10th anniversary of the despicable acts of violence against thousands of innocent Americans, we more importantly remember the heroism found in the American spirit on this day a decade ago. We saw heroism in the firefighters and police officers who bravely entered the Twin Towers never to return to their families again; we saw heroism in the men and women aboard Flight 93 who struck the first counterattack for freedom; and we saw heroism in the families who have continued on without loved ones they never expected to lose forever.As a nation we came together to confront the evil that attacked us that sunny September morning, but we must remain united and vigilant against the threat that still looms, seeking to destroy us not for what we have done but for who we are as a people.Today my prayers are with the families of the men and women, police officers and firefighters who lost their lives 10 years ago and those who continue to heal from the wounds of a decade ago. And as we honor this day and the events that changed our country forever, may we remain steadfast in our commitment to defeating those who stand in such defiance of what it means to be an American."
Rick Santorum,R,s,"September 14, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum - Only One with Record on National Defense,"From the Washington Post: Rick Santorum said, ""As I said on Greta Van Susteren's show last night, I listened to both men answer and I couldn't believe that neither person mentioned the word victory. To stand for anything less is a disservice to our troops, their families, and our nation. Let me be clear, I hate war - and every day I pray for our troops safe and speedy return. In fact, I believe our troops should come home as soon as the job is done. But the problem is, Barack Obama has never outlined a mission for victory. We cannot leave the region when there is still a good chance the Taliban can take control. To leave leadership in the hands of a radical terrorist group, known for its horrific treatment of women and for carrying out unprovoked terrorist attacks on this country - with promises for more - is something I am unwilling to do. The number one job of our president is to defend America, and for Governor Perry to skirt this complicated issue for an applause line shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the region and a level of inexperience only topped by our current president."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"September 14, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum - Pick for Judicial Appointee Under Bush in 2002 Now Rules Against Obamacare,"Santorum Applauds Judges Ruling For the ConstitutionVerona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in response to U.S. District Court Judge Christopher Connor ruling that ObamaCare's requirement for individuals to purchase health insurance is unconstitutional. Senator Santorum said, ""I am so proud that Pennsylvania Judge Chris Conner stood up for the constitution. Now the nation sees what I saw in Chris when I recommended him for the bench under President Bush in 2002. Judge Conner has done a constitutional service for the state of Pennsylvania and the nation by striking another legal blow against Obamacare.I've never waivered on this issue and I have consistently fought against universal healthcare - including leading the charge and defeat of HillaryCare, while Gov. Perry was busy pushing for its expansion. I'm not a recent convert to the fact that universal healthcare is wrong - whether at the state or federal level. And I pledge to repeal ObamaCare on day one as president. ObamaCare has crippled this country and crushed any potential to create jobs. Judge Conner's ruling is a victory for freedom, for American jobs and for the constitution."""

These early states have the deserved reputation of testing candidates and ensuring the emergence of the strongest Republican presidential nominee. The Republican Parties in the early states can count on my support to help maintain their vital role in the process. And I ask the other Republican candidates to have the courage to join me in supporting the early states."""

Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) call on CNBC for the Boeing plant in South Carolina to be unionized.Senator Santorum said: ""Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama are flat out wrong on this issue - and their policy position here is a major reason our economy is struggling. I'm running for President because I understand that this economy can succeed and people can get back to work when the federal government gets out of the way. Simply put, government does not have the right to tell private companies where they can and can't do business. South Carolina, Governor Haley, and Congressman Scott are working with Boeing to bring jobs to their state and they have every right to do so."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"November 4, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum on the Faith Family and Freedom Tour,"Senator Santorum said: ""The economy is inextricably linked to the moral fabric of this country. And we can't have a real solution-based conversation about fixing the economic problems in this country without faith and family being a large part of that conversation. It's wrong for anyone to try and reduce the idea of America solely to economy - because the spirit of America is much more than money - it's faith, family and freedom. The strength of the traditional family, the moral fabric of our nation, and basic value of human life greatly impact our economy. In fact, the family is the first economy, and without strong families we cannot have limited government, nor can we have a vibrant free market economy. Our Founders understood this basic fact, which is why the explicitly declared that our Rights come to each and every individual from God and not to a King to be spread around. Our Founders trusted in free people to make good and moral choices, and we must do that again today if we hope to remain a free and vibrant society.""Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: ""The next president must have the trust of the American people and must possess experience, knowledge, and ability to lead this nation forward. A President Santorum will be able to successfully address all major issues that confront this nation - the economic, the national security and the moral, cultural issues. The press would have you believe that the only issue is the economy - and yes, the economy is certainly a pressing issue - however, to have debates with no questions about the threat of a nuclear Iran and no questions about preserving the traditional American family is a disservice to American people. I will remind folks that in 2008, only one candidate - Tommy Thompson - received the lone health care related question in the presidential debates, and now, healthcare is the cornerstone issue of this election season. We must have a president ready to deal with all issues that come across his desk, and Rick Santorum is the one candidate prepared to do just that."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"November 18, 2011",Statement by Senator Santorum on Failed Effirt To Pass the Balanced Budget Amendment,"Urbandale, IA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in reaction to the House of Representatives failure to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. Constitution:""Today's vote in the House showed who is serious and who is not serious about getting our nation's fiscal house in order. Both parties can talk all they want about fiscal responsibility but passing a Balanced Budget Amendment that requires a supermajority for any tax increase and puts a cap on federal spending at 18% of GDP is the only way to permanently ensure that our government cannot grow beyond its means. A strong Balanced Budget Amendment is the true path to economic prosperity and without it, we simply can't trust the government to actively try and balance the federal budget. Currently, government spending has exploded to nearly 25% of GDP and is well on its way to 40%. This is unacceptable and must be stopped.A strong Balanced Budget Amendment focused on capping spending will empower the American family and build economic freedom - and I commit to using the bully pulpit of the Presidency to get bipartisan support for this commonsense measure - but this time, finish the job."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"November 29, 2011","Statement by Senator Santorum - By Amending Constitution, We Can Balance the Budget for Good","Last summer, we saw a great groundswell of national support to get our fiscal house in order by cutting and capping federal spending and passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. However, the President refused to lead and instead pushed the tough decisions to a bureaucratic Washington committee to solve the problem, and though it was named the ""Supercommittee""? it couldn't even agree on cutting Post-It Notes from the office supply closet. Now, because of the inaction, we are faced with drastic defense cuts at a time when reports show a nuclear Iran has emerged as a clear and present danger. I supported the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance""? movement, but the reality is that what we really need is ""Balance, Balance, Grow""?  because without a balanced budget amendment, and a path to economic prosperity, we cannot ever trust the government to actively try and balance the federal budget. Both parties can talk all they want about fiscal responsibility, but passing a balanced budget amendment that requires a supermajority for any tax increase and puts a cap on federal spending at 18 percent of GDP is the only way to permanently ensure that our government cannot grow beyond its means. Currently, government spending has exploded to nearly 25 percent of GDP and is well on its way to 40 percent. This is unacceptable and must be stopped.Yes, we should cut spending now, but our ultimate goal is to shrink the size and scope of the federal government forever, and passing a balanced budget amendment will permanently cap spending and ensure that our government cannot grow beyond its means.This cornerstone of my economic policy ultimately empowers the American family and builds economic freedom.A balanced budget amendment is a long-term, permanent fix to over-spending, and it would not be a ""draconian""? method because it would not happen overnight. The process to pass and ratify a constitutional amendment will take six to eight years. That not only gives our government time to put our budget on a glide-path to fiscal responsibility, but it sets a deadline for our representatives to get the job done.The best part of my plan to balance the budget is that it will actually work. The first bill I cosponsored in the Senate was the balanced budget amendment, but we came within one vote of passing it. Sadly, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, a Republican, was the deciding ""no""? vote. I stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship because I am not afraid to lead, fight for fiscal responsibility and expose members of my own party when they spend like liberals. Passing a balanced budget amendment will also force our government to address the entitlement crisis crippling our economy. For years, every member of Congress has been afraid of touching entitlements because it is considered the ""third rail of politics.""? But with the passage of the balanced budget amendment, we'll be forced to address this crucial piece of the fiscal puzzle. I know that we can make the tough choices necessary to restructure and save those programs because we've done it before. In 1996, I led the fight to reform the welfare system, ending dependency for millions and providing them with avenues to get back to work. I led that fight and got conservative results despite opposition from a popular President, Bill Clinton, who vetoed the bill twice. And finally, we must implement policies to immediately grow our economy, and this starts with revitalizing our manufacturing sector, which can be the great multiplier on our economy. Yes, we must make more things in America again, but first, we must create an environment that breeds more opportunity here at home. We must eliminate the corporate tax for manufacturers, eliminate all Obama-era regulations that cost business more than $100 million a year, and eliminate the excise tax on overseas profits when those revenues are reinvested in American plants and equipment. We must also make sure the government is not in the way of energy production, and instead increase all forms of energy exploration: whether oil, natural gas, coal, etc. We must reduce the cost of energy across the board for everyone who goes to the pump to fill up their automobile and for the manufacturing plant that produces the automobile itself. This will jump-start our economy, broaden our tax base and, most importantly, rebuild the great middle of our society that has been lost along with our manufacturing jobs over the past 40 years.You can trust my commitment to getting this economy going again, and together we can finish the job we came so close to completing: passing a balanced budget amendment, which is the only way to keep our budget under control for good.Union Leaderby Rick Santorumhttp://www.unionleader.com/article/20111129/OPINION02/711299993"

But when Donald wants to moderate a debate - they refuse to attend. That's what's so wrong with politics today - hypocrisy. At this critical time in our nation's history, just weeks before Iowan's cast this important vote - many of the other candidates want to hide behind TV ads and mail pieces. We plan to be there front and center in person to debate Newt directly, and if it's just the two of us, we're fine with it.There's no doubt that any of us are better than Barack Obama - however, we can't afford to put up a person who can't clearly articulate a vision or has a glass jaw or a unprincipled past. Donald Trump knows business and knows global markets - and we all know he'll be able to bring in a broad audience.

This highlights clearly why we can never allow Iran to have nuclear weapon capabilities. It also reveals the danger of the present administration's refusal to have a clearly articulated plan for dealing with Iran growing nuclear threat, and their failure of having a comprehensive energy plan that includes drilling for energy right here at home. Even worse, President Obama's weakness will only leave a power vacuum for nations like Iran and their militant socialist allies in Central and South America to fill. We can no longer sit by and do nothing, and we need a President prepared to once again stand up for American values around the globe. As President I will do just that.""Rick Santorum is the author of the Iran Freedom & Support Act, which imposed sanctions on Iran and authorized funding for pro-democracy movements within Iran.

From beginning to end, the American people heard more of the same - empty promises and grand platitudes that will do nothing to help the millions of Americans who are unemployed or under employed find a good paying job.Rather than call for decisive action in allowing projects like the Keystone Pipeline or reducing the regulatory burden his Administration has imposed, the President declared war on those who are most successful in our society. Barack Obama should realize he's the President of all Americans, but sadly, he has instead chosen to govern and campaign as the Divider-in-Chief.We need to unite America and create an environment that rewards hard work and success, allowing people the opportunity to rise in society. We need a President who will rebuild the sector that built American economic greatness - manufacturing. My plan is diametrically opposed to that of the President's. Barack Obama speaks of raising taxes and imposing barriers to growth, my plan would eliminate the corporate taxes on manufacturers, eliminate the burdensome regulations of this Administration, and free our market to explore for the energy necessary to grow our economy.Our Party needs to provide a clear contrast with Barack Obama in the general election. Our campaign does just that by focusing a positive message of a resurgent American manufacturing sector, an Administration that will believe in American exceptionalism again, and valuing the dignity of each and every human life. America deserves better than what they heard from Barack Obama tonight."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"February 7, 2012",Statement by Rick Santorum on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' Ruling on Proposition 8,"St. Charles, MO - Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum made the following statement in response to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling on Proposition 8 - the 2008 ballot initiative codifying the traditional definition of marriage as one-man and one-woman.Rick Santorum said: ""Today's decision by the 9th Circuit is another in a long line of radical activist rulings by this rogue circuit - and it is precisely why I have called for that circuit to be abolished and split up. Marriage is defined and has always been defined as 'one man and one woman.' We simply cannot allow 50 different definitions of marriage.The people of California spoke clearly at the ballot box that they wanted marriage defined in the traditional manner of one man and one woman. And for a court, any court, to usurp the power and will of the people in this manner on an issue this fundamental to the foundation of our society is wrong.We need to have a Judicial Branch that acts within its Constitutional bounds. We need to have a President that is willing to stand up to the Judiciary. We need to have a President who will fight to protect marriage once and for all with a federal marriage amendment. I am committed to being that President."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"February 8, 2012","Statement by Rick Santorum on Victories in Minnesota, Colorado and Missouri","WOW. Last night, clean sweep victories in Minnesota, Colorado and Missouri were nothing short of stunning. Overnight we have changed the race for the Presidency. But it wasn't just a big win for our campaign -- it was also a huge win for conservatism and the tea party movement.I'm also quite sure it sent shockwaves across the White House.What this race is clearly coming down to is, do we want a nominee that is willing to fight for fiscal discipline and conservative values? Or do we want Mitt Romney, who agrees with Obama on big government healthcare mandates, the Wall Street Bailouts and radical environmental policy like job killing cap and trade?Yesterday's results indicate loud and clear that people want a nominee who doesn't just talk a good conservative game, but actually lives it. And has the record to prove it. I hope you agree that I am that candidate.There is one thing, though, that Mitt Romney's campaign has plenty of... and that's money. And we can't let that be the deciding factor for who becomes the Republican nominee.Our campaign can counter that with thousands and thousands of small dollar contributions from conservatives and tea party supporters all over the country who are willing to fight to take back the White House.Your immediate contribution of $10, $50 or $500 to our Pick Rick Moneybomb will allow us to continue the momentum we started last night with our wins in Minnesota, Colorado and Missouri. And with Super Tuesday just a few weeks away, it's imperative that we have the money to start television advertising in those states.Since day one, I have considered you an invaluable running mate in my efforts to become President of the United States, and Karen and I will always be grateful for what you have already done. But now I must count on you again for an immediate contribution to our Moneybomb. I want to thank you in advance for what I am sure you will do to help us now. Fighting for America,Rick"

Today's proposal of nearly $4 trillion in spending over the next year is preposterous, not only in overall funding but in priorities. If we do not get our spending under control, we will have turmoil in the streets - and that's not a guess - all you have to do is look to Europe. America needs to lead, and America needs a leader prepared to make those tough choices. I am committed to balancing our budget and cutting $5 trillion in spending in five years. These are the measures necessary to not just put our nation's fiscal house in order, but to spur on economic growth and confidence in our free-market system."""

We saw leadership today by a group of people unwilling to allow environmental extremists to set our energy policy. We need reliable sources of domestic energy to fuel our economy and reinvigorate our manufacturing sector, but not just that - this vote was about American jobs and America's national security. Today's vote is a step in that direction. While it is clear that Harry Reid and Barack Obama will stand in the way of this common-sense legislation, as president I will work with House Republicans and reasonable Democrats to sign similar legislation into law so we can lower energy costs and make real steps toward energy independence."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"February 20, 2012",Statement by Rick Santorum - Obama's Weekly Message Focused on a Renewal of Manufacturing Jobs - But There's No Chance of Renewal With This President,"Santorum RespondsVerona, PA - Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum made the following statement in response to President Obama call for a renewal of American manufacturing in his weekly address to the nation.Rick Santorum said: ""It was ironic that President Obama would make his call to renew American manufacturing from a Boeing plant considering his Administration's moves to keep Boeing from expanding and creating thousands of jobs in South Carolina.Time and time this President has crushed American industry by doing the bidding of his cronies in Big Labor and adhering to the agenda of the Radical Environmental Left. In fact, President Obama has effectively placed a boot on the neck of American industry with his environmental regulations and taxes that make us less competitive with the rest of the world. We need a president who understands that the private sector creates jobs, not the government. We need to encourage manufacturing - which is exactly why my economic plan focuses on that sector of our economy. But I take a far different approach than President Obama - I focus on empowering business from the bottom-up, not the government knows best top-down approach. We need to free American enterprise, America's entrepreneurial spirit, and American industry to grow; and this president is doing the exact opposite. As president, I commit to standing up for manufacturing by completely eliminating the corporate tax for manufacturers and repealing the Obama Administration's onerous regulations. For years, we've heard that manufacturing jobs are gone for good - but I know that's not true, and I'm not willing to surrender these jobs to China as quickly as this Presidents is. If we can create a level playing field, I know with all my heart that the American worker will outperform anyone else in the world."""

This is just another example of the misplaced priorities of the Obama Administration. This is not about voter disenfranchisement, it is about ensuring that our electoral system has integrity and voters are confident that their vote is counted accurately and fairly. I commend Governor Perry, Texas, and the many states like Texas that are fighting to ensure voter fraud does not impede the electoral process.

This is just another attempt by the Romney Campaign to distort and distract the media and voters from the unshakeable fact that many of Romney's policies mirror Barack Obama's. I was simply making the point that there is a huge enthusiasm gap around Mitt Romney and it's easy to see why - Romney has sided with Obama on healthcare mandates, cap-and-trade, and the Wall Street bailouts. Voters have to be excited enough to actually go vote, and my campaign's movement to restore freedom is exciting this nation. If this election is about Obama versus the Obama-Lite candidate, we have a tough time rallying this nation. It's time for bold vision, bold reforms and bold contrasts. This election is about more than Barack Obama, Mitt Romney, or Rick Santorum - this campaign is about freedom and I will fight to restore your freedoms."""

Rick Santorum,R,s,"March 27, 2012",Statement by Mitt Romney on the Obama Administration's Missile Defense Policy,"Verona, PA - It was reported that President Barack Obama made the astounding remark that he would ""have more flexibility"" in negotiating the European missile defense system with Russia after the election.Rick Santorum said: ""This is not about an open microphone, and it's not about politics, this is about a fundamentally flawed vision for securing America. When Ronald Reagan was confronted with the Soviet missile threat, he said trust but verify. When Barack Obama is confronted with missile defense negotiations, he says 'wait and I'll have flexibility.' The difference is enormous. The President's retreat from missile defense shows he is comfortable endangering America and her allies. This is not presidential leadership, and as our next Commander-in-Chief I am committed to standing firm on the issue of missile defense and the security of America and her allies."""
Rick Santorum,R,s,"April 9, 2012",Statement by Rick Santorum: Unleashing America's Energy Revolution,"President Obama has demonstrated he does not know how to solve our energy problems and address our need for energy security. I would suggest he visit Pennsylvania to see how we do it right.Below Pennsylvania's mosaic of cities, suburbs, villages, lakes, farms and highways lay vast reserves of energy. Pennsylvania is developing these energy resources, creating a surge of economic activity and good jobs at good wages for Pennsylvania men and women.Pennsylvania produced over 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in 2011. It has 409 wells in the Marcellus Shale, a geologic formation that stretches into New York and West Virginia. These wells have given the Keystone State an added $1.7 billion in economic activity a year.I support American energy. In my first 100 days as president I'll approve the Keystone Pipeline so we can create jobs and energy security by growing our partnerships with allies like Canada rather than sending their oil to China instead. I'll also sign an executive order unleashing America's domestic energy production without picking winners and losers. I'll allow states to choose where they want to explore for oil and natural gas so all states can have Pennsylvania's opportunities.In addition, I'll eliminate Obama regulations that have onerous economic burdens, including rules on CO2 emissions and the radical environmental rule change by President Obama designed to shut down power plants. I'll order a review of all regulations, making sure they meet common sense cost-benefit tests.It's not just Pennsylvania that understands that America must unleash its energy production. North Dakota, Texas, Arkansas and others, are tapping into oil and natural gas reserves using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing has made trillions of cubic feet potentially available, and has driven the price of natural gas down to its current level of $2.04 per million Btu from $7 or $8 per million Btu between 2004 and 2009, and increase recoverable natural gas. Natural gas is a clean burning fuel. Emissions from natural gas burning automobiles are 25 percent cleaner than from gasoline or diesel engines.My economic freedom agenda begins with unleashing America's domestic energy potential through the New American Energy Revolution. This revolution relies on market forces and private sector research and development capabilities to create new jobs and provide energy security from our enemies. Thanks to improved technology, this can be done so in an environmentally responsible manner and in a manner that helps families in need of good jobs. I will also expedite the approval of leasing and permitting for domestic oil and gas companies in crucial onshore and offshore locales on day one of my administration.I continue to support exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska and on other federal lands. The role ofgovernment should be to unleash our resources, not keep them in the ground. The private sector and entrepreneurs have shown how to grow the economy, create jobs, and help struggling communities in the process. Unlike President Obama, I will allow states, rather than the Environmental Protection Agency, to set their own regulations regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing technology, giving America access to vast proven oil and gas reserves.Unfortunately, radical energy agendas are nothing new to Mitt Romney either. While governor, Romney supported restrictions on carbon emissions-especially those targeting the abundant resources of coal. In Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky and throughout America, coal has been important to economic success. Mitt Romney bragged that Massachusetts was ""the first and only state to set CO2 emissions limits on power plants."" Massachusetts was also the first state to set carbon dioxide emissions on power plants. In a press release on December 5, 2005, then-Governor Romney said, ""These carbon emission limits will provide real and immediate progress in the battle to improve our environment. They help us accomplish our environmental goals while protecting jobs and the economy."" Now under President Obama's similar approach more than 100 power plants are closed or are planning to close. This is not good for our economy or for families and businesses in need of lower energy prices.Perhaps since residents of Massachusetts are used to paying the highest healthcare premiums in the nation under RomneyCare, they will be OK with high energy prices as well. Those are the policies that produced the 47th lowest job creation rate in the country under Governor Romney. This is not the vision for freedom and opportunity for all that most Americans and most states desire. This is Obama-lite.President Obama's flawed energy policy and Governor Romney's support of radical environmentalists have produced policies which prevent the development of American energy and punish the American consumer, instead of unleashing America's domestic energy potential and securing our future. Pennsylvania has shown a better way; we should not be stopping that progress now with Big Government and job killing regulations.I'm in favor of growing the American economy through pro-growth tax and regulatory policies, including unleashing the energy sector in Pennsylvania and across America. This has always been my policy. Picking winners and losers is a job for the free market and not government. President Obama's no, no, no American energy ""strategy"" will not provide the bright future we desire. Governor Romney's no, maybe, no energy track record is not the bold free market leadership we need for our future, our businesses, our families, and for our national security. Unlike in the stock market or on Wall Street, in government, past performance is indicative of future performance. Governor Romney also once said that he is for cap and trade as long as the whole world is part of it. In contrast to promoting Big Government and global schemes that disadvantage America, my focus is on promoting freedom and opportunity here at home for all Americans. Unleashing the American entrepreneurial spirit and all forms of America's domestic energy potential will do just that for Pennsylvania and across our land."

You may have heard that we were able to bring her home from the hospital last night.She has pneumonia, but like her Dad, she's a fighter. It's in the blood.Today I announced that I am suspending my campaign for the President of the United States. This has been one of the hardest decisions Karen and I have ever had to face together. And it has been hard in large measure because of you. I know that my candidacy has offered you a way to fight for your convictions, and I do not want to let you down.Since I first ran for Congress in a Democrat-majority district in Pittsburgh, I have fought for struggling families. I have fought for the unborn. I have fought for those losing hope in the American Dream.And during this Presidential race we have fought hard. Together. You have been with me every step of the way. Every volunteer, donor, friend and family has given sacrificially of their time and their treasure. We are humbled and thankful.We literally started this campaign in our kitchen with family and a few friends. The way that you make decisions. We believe America is the land of opportunity, and decided to do what we can to protect the hope that our forefathers sacrificed to give us a future for our children. A future of freedom secured through our sacrifices today.Over 160,000 of you contributed to the campaign. Like you have for your children, we have sacrificed almost everything we have to ensure that this hope and dream is not lost with another four years under Barack Obama. Our average donation has been only $73.10. Few races in history have so many people give so modestly to preserve liberty.We have been outspent in most states 5-1 or even 10-1. And we still won, or we've come incredibly close. Iowa and the three-state sweep. An over 20-point win in Louisiana. Only a few votes short of victory in Michigan and Ohio. We have made history. There has been no other Presidential comeback race like ours.Our good friends in Texas have been working non-stop to make sure that they have a say in the choice of our nominee, but without the state changing its delegate allocation to winner-take-all, I do not see a path forward that does not risk our shared objective of defeating Barack Obama in November. I want to thank them for their valiant efforts.I am planning to do everything in my power to bring a change about in the White House. But our campaign has debt, and I cannot be free to focus on helping defeat him with this burden. I am asking you to consider one more contribution of $25, $50 or even $73.10.From the start of this race I have offered a unique voice in the debate. One that the party and the country needs to hear. I have been your voice. I have been positive. I have been willing to stand for issues that some believe are controversial and would prefer to sweep under the rug.We have carried the torch. High. Together we have fought for the principles that this country was founded on; that made this country great. Without fighting for them, this country cannot continue to be great.And we have fought fair. I am proud of the race we have run. We talked issues. We avoided character attacks. We have run almost entirely positive ads.I want to continue to be your voice. Please CLICK HERE to contribute $25, $50 or even $73.10. We have had miraculous days of almost $1 million from supporters like you that allowed us to be competitive and win key states. We need you to step up again.When I ran for the Senate in 1994 and defeated a sitting incumbent Senator, I asked the people of Pennsylvania to Join the Fight. They did.I know you will. God bless you, and please keep us in your prayers. And know that we keep you in ours."

I can understand why President Obama and his Justice Department sit on their hands and let these crimes continue. It was Barack Obama who voted against the Illinois state version of the Born Alive Infant Protection Act. Barack Obama clearly doesn't have a problem with the murder of an innocent child born as a result of a botched abortion. This is sickening and state authorities must take action if the federal government will not.""Rick Santorum was the author of every major piece of pro-life legislation that came before the U.S. Senate during his tenure.

Yet President Obama has decided to again abandon them and our security to appease the fringe environmental Left.Under my Administration, we will commit to an all-of-the-above energy policy that will not just bring cheap energy prices to consumers at the pump, but will lower prices upstream for manufacturers and processors that depend on energy to make the products we use every day.

He does not understand that they hate us, not for what we do, but they hate us for who we are and what we stand for. Radical Islam is intent on establishing a caliphate to spread their version of Islam, and in the case of Iran, developing a nuclear weapon to bring about the end of the World,"" continued Santorum.""Barack Obama needs to get a grip on reality right now! Stop blaming Israel, stop blaming people with compassion for the persecuted, and start looking in the mirror. Otherwise, Iran will continue on the path to a nuclear weapon to bring about the return of their 12th Imam. ISIS will continue to kill innocent civilians through coordinated attacks.
