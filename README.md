# XRHETOR-R1A

This repo contains the new module for Prof. Amy Tick's XRHETOR-R1A class for Fall 2016 and Fall 2017.

The Spring 2018 materials were created by Alec Kan, Shalini Kunapuli, and William McEachen. These modules connect word use in political speeches to the Moral Foundations Theory. Statistical inferences and visualizations from this data help students better understand rhetoric differences between conservative and liberal presidential candidates. This module is meant to take 3 class periods for students with minimal to no coding experience.

The archived Fall 2017 module was created by Sujude Dalieh, Jonathan Lin, Keeley Takimoto, and Sean Seungwoo Son. These modules explore term frequency in speeches as well as an analysis of California State voter data. The voter data module is meant to take 3 class periods with two homework assignments and leads students with no coding experience through a hands-on analysis of voting trends that led up to the election in 2016.
