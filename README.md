The Fall 2016 materials were created by Alexander Ivanoff, Julian Kudszus, Aditya Sheth and Tracy Chen. These modules explore term frequency in speeches as well as an analysis of California State voter data. The voter data module is meant to take 3 class periods with two homework assignments and leads students with no coding experience through a hands-on analysis of voting trends that led up to the election in 2016.

The archived Political Data Institute Fall 2016 module created by Alexander Ivanoff, Aditya Sheth, Julian Kudzsus, and Tracy Chen is also in this repo.
